<td width=50%><b>Artinian:</b> Let R be a ring. An R-module M is said to be <i>artinian</i> if
whenever M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, ... is a sequence of R-submodules of
M with<br> <center>M<sub>1</sub> &supe; M<sub>2</sub> &supe; ...</center> then there
there exists a positive integer n such that M<sub>m</sub> = M<sub>n</sub> for every m &ge; n.
<p>
Each doll in this sequence represents one of the M<sub>i</sub>. While this
is perhaps a fairly straightforward visual metaphor for an artinian
module, it is important to note that while this photograph implies
that the M<sub>i</sub> are decreasing in "size" (cardinality), this need
not be the case: for instance, all of the submodules could be
countably infinite. Rather, we have that each M<sub>i</sub> contains
M<sub>i+1</sub>. While these dolls obviously do not contain one another in
the photograph, the use of matryoshka dolls gives a nod to the
notion of containment. As we move from left to right, the dolls
eventually become the same in size, reflecting the fact that a
descending sequence of submodules of an artinian module must
eventually become stationary: that is, after some point in the
sequence, the M<sub>i</sub> are all identical.<p>
