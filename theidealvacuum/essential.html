<td width=50%><b>Essential:</b> Let R be a ring.  A submodule 
N of an R-module M is said to be <i>essential</i> in 
M if whenever L&ne;0 is a submodule of M, then 
N&cap;L&ne;0.
<p>
The idea behind this photograph is to portray the "expansiveness"
of an essential submodule. To use a linguistic metaphor, an
essential submodule N of a module M is a submodule that has its
fingers in the pots of every one of M's submodules: if L is any
nontrivial submodule of M, then N and L must have a nontrivial
intersection. N need not contain many elements, however; its
significance in M is due to its "density" in M, so to speak,
rather than to its size.  This photograph attempts to convey this
density: the tree (our submodule) fills the picture (our module),
leaving no room in which other submodules can play without its
leaves getting in the way..
