<b>Assignment 1: Due Wednesday, January 8</b><p>
<ul><li>Complete and share a brief <a href="bio.docx">biography</a>, using the template provided in the preceding link.</li>

	<li>Submit via email a list of three or more pop culture artifacts (e.g., movies, television show episodes, music videos, manga, computer games, etc.), other than <i>The Imitation Game</i>,  which discuss cryptography. These should <i>not</i> be materials, such as Khan Academy videos or <i>My Favorite Theorem</i> podcasts that are primarily educational in nature. If you can't find three, do you have a theory as to why this might be the case?</li>

<b>Assignment 2: Due Friday, January 10</b><p>

	<li><b>Additional problems:</b>
	<ol><li> Use a Vigen&egrave;re cipher with keyword BEAR to encrypt the word <TT>QUIET</TT> and decrypt the word <TT>GENTZ</TT>.</li>
		<li>Compute 56290 mod 73 by hand, explaining your method. (You may use your calculator to perform arithmetic.)</li>
	</ol></li>
	<li><b><a href="rsaws.pdf">RSA worksheet</a>:</b> #1&ndash;3.</li>

<p><hr><p>
<b>Assignment 3: Due Tuesday, January 14</b><p>
<ul>
	<li><b><a href="rsaws.pdf">RSA worksheet</a>:</b> #4 (if you haven't already turned it in)</li>
	<li>Submit via email your response to the 11th question in the <a href="https://community.plu.edu/~sklarjk/107/discussionquestions.docx">Film Discussion Questions</a> document, with respect to <i>The Imitation Game</i>. Please submit your response as an individual (that is, don't submit a group answer), and please write a thoughtful response. There is no word requirement or limit, but a single sentence like "It didn't change anything" would not be considered a sufficient response. You may send your response in the body of an email or as a Word attachment to an email, or share it with me as a Google Doc. If you send it as an attachment, please include your name in the document title.
