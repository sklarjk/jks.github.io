<td width=50%><b>Ideal:</b> Let R be a ring.  A subset I of 
R is said to be an <i>ideal</i> of R if it's a subgroup of 
R, and has the property that for every r in R, we 
have <br>rI &sube; I and Ir &sube; I.
<p>
One way to recall the definition of an ideal is to remember that
ideals "suck." If I is an ideal of ring R, then when any 
element of R is multiplied by any element of I, the 
resulting element must be in I; in a sense, the ideal uses 
multiplication to draw elements into itself.  Granted, like our metaphor 
for an <a 
href="invertiblefunction.html">Invertible 
Function</a>, this 
isn't a perfect explanation of the situation: if an element r of 
R is multiplied by an element of I, r itself does 
not 
become a member of I.  However, this colorful 
description of I's role in R can be extremely pedagogically 
useful: people remember the concept, because they love saying that things 
"suck."<p>
Hence, the photograph.
