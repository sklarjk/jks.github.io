<td width=50%><b>Invertible function:</b> A function f from a set X to a set Y is said to be <i>
invertible</i> if there exists a function g from Y to X such that
f(g(y)) = y and g(f(x)) = x for every y in Y and x in X.

<p>In this image, we see a standard hourglass; applying our function
f corresponds to flipping the hourglass.  When f is applied, the
grains of sand (elements) in the top of the hourglass (set X) are
sent to the bottom of the hourglass (set Y). This action can then
be reversed: we can send the grains of sand (now elements of Y)
back to set X by, literally, inverting the hourglass&mdash;this action
corresponds to applying function g, the inverse of f.  While
flipping an hourglass is not exactly a function (it does not, in
fact, send grains of sand bijectively to other grains of sand), it
captures the notion of invertibility: it is an action that can be
reversed, ad infinitum, to send elements back from whence they
came.
