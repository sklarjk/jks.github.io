<td width=50%><b>Noetherian:</b> Let R be a ring. An R-module M is said to be <i>noetherian</i> if
whenever M<sub>1</sub>, M<sub>2</sub>, ... is a sequence of R-submodules of
M with<br>
<center>M<sub>1</sub> &sube; M<sub>2</sub> &sube; ...</center> then there
there exists a positive integer n such that M<sub>m</sub> = M<sub>n</sub> for every m &ge; n.
<p>
Noetherian is the mathematical dual of artinian.  In a noetherian
module, each submodule M<sub>i</sub> is contained <i>in</i> (rather than
contained <i>by</i>) the submodule M<sub>i+1</sub>. Eventually the sequence
of submodules becomes stationary. In an analogous situation to that
of the photograph <a href="artinian.html"><i>Artinian</i></a>, this is represented by the
matryoshka dolls eventually (as we move from left to right) becoming
constant in size.<p>
