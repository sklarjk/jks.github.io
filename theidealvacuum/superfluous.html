<td width=50%><b>Superfluous:</b> Let R be a ring.  A submodule 
N of an R-module M is said to be <i>superfluous</i> 
in M if whenever L &ne; M is a submodule of M, 
then N+L &ne; M.
<p>
In contrast to the tree in the photograph <a 
href="essential.html">Essential</a>, this tree 
is hardly space-filling.  
As in the case of essentialness, superfluity has more to do with density 
than with size: a submodule is superfluous if it is, in some sense, sparse 
in the module.  Specifically, a submodule is superfluous in M if it 
is so "small" that it cannot generate all of M even when taken 
together with any other proper R-submodule. Using trees in the 
photographs for the concepts of both "essential" and "superfluous" 
emphasizes these adjectives' natures as mathematical duals.
